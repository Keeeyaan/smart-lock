# Smart Lock
Smart Lock is an Arduino-based project that combines the convenience of web technology with the reliability of RFID authentication through serial communication. Through a user-friendly web interface, users can remotely manage and control their locks, granting or revoking access privileges from anywhere. The system incorporates RFID readers and tags, allowing for effortless unlocking by waving authorized cards or tags in front of the sensor.
